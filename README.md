## Summary
Overall CitiBike NYC sees quite a bit of bike traffic. Based on the infomation provided in the dashboard:
 
 - Most of the user base are male subscribers who use citibikes Monday - Friday for commuting.

 - There is much less of intrastructure and population compared to NYC to just roll out city bikes to Des Moines.

    - There needs to be an analysis done comparing the two cities demographics, age and gender.
    - with this we can use the rends from the results and the NYC dashbaord to estimate whether or not expanding to a new city would be successful.
